/*
 * Implementation of Blink module
 *
 */

 // Start every module with at least these two includes:
#include <Arduino.h>
#include "modules.h"
// Also include this module's header file:
#include "_blink.h"

// Unline header file (.h), module implementation file of a module (.ino.h)
// must not be included multiple times:
#ifdef BLINK_IMPLEMENTATION
	#error The .ino.h file of a module can be included only once (and should be included from main.ino). Did you wanted to include the .h file instead?
#endif
#define BLINK_IMPLEMENTATION


// Module's setup() function:
// (copied from default BlinkWithoutDelay.ino example)
void Blink::setup()
{
	blink->interval = 1000;
	pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}


// Module's loop() function:
// (copied from default BlinkWithoutDelay.ino example, with some comments added)
void Blink::loop()
{
	// here is where you'd put code that needs to be running all the time.

	// check to see if it's time to blink the LED; that is, if the
	// difference between the current time and last time you blinked
	// the LED is bigger than the interval at which you want to
	// blink the LED.

	// this is a local variable, it exists only within while this function is running:
	unsigned long currentMillis = millis();

	// previousMillis and interval are module functions.
	// Completely equivalent way of writing that "if" statement:
	// if (currentMillis - blink->previousMillis >= blink->interval) ...

	if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval) {
		// save the last time you blinked the LED
		previousMillis = currentMillis;

		// if the LED is off turn it on and vice-versa:
		if (ledState == LOW) {
			ledState = HIGH;
		} else {
			ledState = LOW;
		}

		// set the LED with the ledState of the variable:
		digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState);
	}
}
